        "This chatbot is a simple virtual assistant designed to help customers with their basic questions and support needs. When a user types something into the chat, the chatbot tries to understand their request, whether it’s tracking an order, asking about shipping times, learning how to return a product, or seeking recommendations for a new gadget. The chatbot responds in a friendly, polite way, giving helpful answers instantly and even making product suggestions from its virtual catalog. If a user just wants to chat or asks for a joke, the bot can do that too, making the experience more conversational and enjoyable. For those unsure what to ask, the chatbot can show a help menu, and it’s also ready to collect feedback from users. At the end of each conversation, it saves a record of the entire chat so conversations can be reviewed later. This means the chatbot is not only practical for answering common support questions but is also user-friendly, interactive, and easy to expand.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Exiting the ChatBot\n",
        "The chatbot is designed to run continuously so users can ask as many questions as they like. The only way to exit the chat loop is by typing a specific keyword such as \"quit\", \"exit\", or \"bye\". When the chatbot detects any of these words, it responds with a farewell, breaks the loop, and ends the chat session."
